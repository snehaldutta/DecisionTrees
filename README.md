# Decision Trees
In this repo, we have discussed Decision Trees and its core working. Everything is coded in **Python**.

# Libraries

1. Pandas - for data exploration and cleaning
2. Scikit - for model initialization, training, validation, and testing
3. Matplotlib - for visualization of various metrics

In this repo, we have built two types of Decision Trees:
- **Classification Decision Tree**: This tree has been built on a  dataset of [**Heart Disease**](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease). There were 306 data points on which the classifier was built. The tree aims to classify whether the patient has a heart disease or not.
  
- **Regression Decision Tree**: This tree has been built on a dataset of [**Petrol Consumption**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harinir/petrol-consumption). There were 48 data points on which the regression tree was built. The tree aims to predict the petrol consumption.

Here we come to the end of the whole repo....
